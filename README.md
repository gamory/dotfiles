## Dotfiles

Here are various configuration files that I tend to use.  I got pretty tired of always needing to move them between machines when I re-installed them.  Some are modified very lightly from defaults (such as the i3 configs).  Others are written entirely from scratch.  Where possible, I generally try to comment them in the file.
